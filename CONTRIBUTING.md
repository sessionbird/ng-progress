# Pull Request Guidelines

We all love Pull Requests so if you have something you'd like to share with the community we'd be happy to help you out with contributing. But before you create your PR please read and understand the following. :heart:

## Communication

Much of the issues, goals and ideas are tracked in the in GitHub. Please use this channel to report bugs and post ideas.

## git and GitHub

In order to contribute code please:

1. Fork the project on GitHub
2. Clone the project
3. Add changes (and tests)
4. Commit and push
5. Create a merge-request

To have your code merged, see the expectations listed below.

You can find a well-written guide [here](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo).

Please follow common commit best-practices. Be explicit, have a short summary, a well-written description and references. This is especially important for the merge-request.

## Style

Following the same code style makes all of our lives a bit easier, currently we ask that you use:

- 2 spaces for indenting
- No trailing spaces
- One trailing newline at the end of each file
